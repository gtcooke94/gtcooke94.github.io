[{"categories":null,"contents":"One of the challenging requirements of large multi-robot systems is scalable communication methods that are robust to noisy low-communication environments. On a multi-hop, wireless sensor network, it may be desirable for a node to issue a system-wide alert on detection of an event of interest. However, if there is a high false-positive rate, then system-wide false alarms may frequently occur. Giant honeybees (Apis dorsata) generate large-scale spiral waves triggered by the presence of a threat. Studies show that the initial seed of the waves and the re-transmission behavior are non-trivial and thus may be specially tuned for this low-communication scenario. Motivated by these adaptive patterns in giant honeybees, we develop a distributed approach for sharing awareness of critical events that is able to damp the propagation of false-alarm signals. We validate the algorithmâ€™s performance for a WSN detecting a hostile UAV in the SCRIMMAGE simulation framework.\n","permalink":"http://gtcooke94.github.io/publications/trustbasedrobots/","tags":["Research","Robotics"],"title":"Trust-based Information Propagation on Multi-robot Teams in Noisy Low-communication Environments"},{"categories":null,"contents":"We consider the problem of using only local communication to implement a distributed algorithm for large teams of mobile robots that searches space for locations of interest and distributes the robots across those locations according to quality. Toward this end, we take inspiration from insect societies that are able to coordinate without the use of pheromone trails. In particular, we focus on species that use only one-on-one local interactions to adaptively distribute scouts during nest-site selection tasks. Thus, there is a direct analogy between the insect communication mechanisms and peer-to-peer communication implementable in mobile, ad hoc networks of robots. Using chemical reaction networks as a conceptual bridge between behavioral descriptions from biology and event-triggered rules for robots, we develop a stochastic, biomimetic algorithm that achieves the desired goal. To validate our approach, we implement the algorithm on a large swarm of aerial, fixed-wing robots operating within the high-fidelity simulation package, SCRIMMAGE.\n","permalink":"http://gtcooke94.github.io/publications/nestsiteselection/","tags":["Research","Robotics"],"title":"Bio-inspired Nest-Site Selection for Distributing Robots in Low-Communication Environments"}]
